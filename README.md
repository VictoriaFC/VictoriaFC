I am a Front-End Software Engineer looking to connect with companies that share my passion for creating accessible applications, encourage personal and professional growth, and have a passion for an excellent UI/UX experience. 

The journey that led me here started with aspirations to become a wedding planner that evolved into a career path split between working in the oil and gas industry and marketing. After years of developing different professional skills and learning how I best contribute to a team I was drawn to Frontend engineering. I am excited to utilize my professional strengths and new skill set to shift my career to a React, Javascript, and CSS/HTML role with a strong interest in UI/UX. I am eager to learn more and look forward to any opportunity to ask questions, gain new insights, and contribute to a team with a goal to make people's experiences better.
